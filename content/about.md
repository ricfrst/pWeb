### Academic Background 
I am a student at Florida State University. I spent two years here doing Finance and recently realized that my passion was elsewhere.

I started coding for fun around August of last year, and quickly noticed that it was something that I wanted to keep doing professionally. Naturally, I had to take quick action and rerout my academic life. And so here we stand.

### Myself
Originally from Brazil, I came here at a very young age.
Recently got into Photography as well, and begun to collect physical music. All for the sake of admiring and cherishing the rife of beauty that is present in the mundane.
